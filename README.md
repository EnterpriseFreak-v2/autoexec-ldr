# autoexec-ldr
autoexec-ldr is a minimal homebrew loader for the Nintendo GameCube that is intended for use together with savegame exploits like the Zelda: WW Hack. It supports SD cards above 2 GB in size formatted with the FAT16 or FAT32 filesystems. SD cards can be either plugged into a SD Gecko in Memory Card Slot B or in a SD2SP2 adapter (not tested but it should work).
